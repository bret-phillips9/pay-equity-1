Creation of a tool to quickly assess pay equity for a specific focal group using self-developed ladder analysis methodology

## Purpose 
This tool accepts a roster of pay data and returns a quick pay equity analysis based on a technique I call "ladder analysis."

## Ladder Analysis
Ladder analysis has its roots in OFCCP's "Dubray Method" of analyzing summary (what was then known as Item 11, pre-2013) compensation data by grade or level.  However, ladder analysis improves on the Dubray Method by adding actual inferential statistics to the analysis.  It can be proven with simple algebra that the difference in pay between two group means is equivalent to the difference between one of the group's incumbency (% of workforce) and its share of total compensation paid to all workers.  This enables us to use a one-group z-test, which can easily be done with summary data.

## Limitations
Ladder analysis, while an improvement on the Dubray Method, has important limitations.  Like the Dubray Method, ladder analysis assumes that everyone on the same "rung" of the ladder (grade/band/level) is equal on all other pay-related factors.  Only regression analysis of a detailed compensation roster can ensure other factors are accounted for.  Still, ladder analysis may serve as a quick and useful first signal that a deeper analysis should be undertaken.

## Data Privacy and Disclaimer
Note that when the tool is exited, the uploaded data are deleted from working memory.  Nevertheless, you should not upload personally identifiable information (PII) to the tool.  In addition, your company's pay data, even in aggregate form, may be considered a confidential trade secret.  I take no responsibility for any leaks of PII or trade secrets as a result of using the tool.  The tool is provided for demonstration purposes only.  A pay equity audit should be conducted under the guidance of an attorney.  Use at your own risk.
